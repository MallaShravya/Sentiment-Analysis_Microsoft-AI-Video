1,This feels like one of the fake concept videos that I used to see years ago. I know it isn't but this stuff feels to advanced to be true.
2,That will only serve to give them more work‚Ä¶ I don‚Äôt think that can make my childhood dreams come true‚Ä¶
3,They can't possibly think any executive is going to now pay a professional designer to create a presentation for them when they can do it themselves. Congratulations to Microsoft. They have just managed to put an entire industry out of work. My heart bleeds for everyone of us affected by this misplaced excitement.
4,Big day at the clickfarm it seems
5,"America and China set up a course in religion, literature,history, media, education. economy of Bangladesh to play a artificial mind game of Rizvy"
6,This is going to be a huge productivity driver for the next decade..so much potential and so many hours saved. Generative AI at its best!
7,"question, if you're doing more work with co-pilot, will you be rewarded with a rise in your salary? or if you don't use it, will you be considered a slacker and lazy? can you lose your job if you're skillful?"
8,"cool technology, but mindless and meaningless. Why anyone care for content made by imitation AI. The internet is full of content smart, less smart and even more less smart content. You may risk your own credibility while using products similar to this. Remember to validate always and dont become skilless."
9,"Humanity is the training data, the model is still maximizing the companies bottom line."
10,when is CoPilot available in 365?
11,RIP 80% of jobs in developed countries
12,nice
13,I already can't find a job.
14,"Despite all the grand rhetoric, I cannot help but feel that this technology is anti-human at its core. Misguided, I feel."
15,"(NO SHOUTING. DO NOT CENSOR) SATYA NADELLA, THE CEO WHO MISSED THE MOBILE SMARTPHONE BOAT AND ESPECIALLY ALL THE SOFTWARE ASSOCIATED WITH IT?!!! IT IS NOT TOO LATE NADELLA. JUST CREATE SMARTPHONES USING ONLY INTEL PROCESSORS AND GOOGLE ANDROID PORTED ON THESE INTEL PROCESSORS AND BEING ABLE TO LOG IN ON ANY SCREEN AND USE WINDOWS AND ALL ITS SOFTWARE PROGRAMS, THAT WOULD GIVE A SERIOUS COMPETITION TO GOOGLE ANDROID!!!"
16,Life saving technology for the fake-it-till-ya-make-it crowd.  ü§£
17,Give me some money.
18,the artificial intel is so much less artificial than the presenters
19,"Well if AI ever needed a substrate to propagate itself across the entire planet, leave it to Microsoft to kick off the apocalypse"
20,This might actually make me stop pirating office
21,"""must do so responsibly"" didn't you just fire the whole AI ethics team?"
22,There will be no UBI for my fellow Americans. You will starve and die while the rich line their pockets even more. I wish you all the best of luck.
23,"This won't replace all Data Analyst jobs but it will replace like 75% percent of them. Top data analysts are going to be fine, but in my work experience most DA's especially in larger firms are doing things Microsoft Copilot can either already do or will be able to do in the near future. Most people are completely oblivious to all of this AI stuff...the world is going to change drastically and many will be caught blind-sighted."
24,We are the new dinosaurs.
25,"So, how are Palantir shareholders doing ?"
26,Well we don't have to type comment in future! They can read Your mind!
27,This is too scary.  Satya is a great communicator and he puts you in some comfort level.  Responsibility-based AI?  Thats impossible.  Humans are inherently evil.
28,In short....humans are dinosaurs and our meteor is passing Jupiter.
29,Dog is my copilot...
30,"frightening.... this is NOT about making humans more efficient, this is about making humans not being humans anymore..."
31,"No way‚Ä¶ we really gonna lose control of our society, it‚Äôs impressive, but after this AI, another will come, and an another, and maybe after 3 or 4 or 10, it‚Äôll not be necessary to have a human to command it! Just 3 months after ChatGPT, we have that, think about it‚Ä¶"
32,Lady is named Sumit.ü§¶
33,In something like this I thought privacy would be something that would be talked about but was not even mentioned üòû
34,Groth
35,I'm pausing every 15 seconds! This is absolutely insane!
36,"Lol when she says, ""You're not going to send this to a customer without a thorough review."""
37,We could use co-pilot to manage conversations with spouse? I think that will be of great help.
38,NO  COMMENTS
39,"Don't forget to ""uplevel"" your skills"
40,Fantastic!
41,Work manship cut off
42,"However, in general, a comment on a video about the future of work with AI might express excitement about the potential for AI to transform the workplace, while also acknowledging the need to address potential concerns around job displacement and the ethical use of AI. The comment might also reflect on personal experiences with AI in the workplace or offer insights on how AI might be integrated into different industries."
43,"I am really happy that the way technology is evolving and people are getting more ease on work. But, do you think how much safe our jobs will be in future?"
44,"This is going to make incompetent humans seem competent, upending the human intelligence hierarchy and demotivating eloquent, talented humans that were proud of their skills and the advantages that they enjoyed because of them."
45,"It's also going to reduce individuality and the influence of personality, and will cause us to enjoy consuming written information less as we increasingly doubt whether a human or an AI is behind it (we crave the connection with the mind of another actual human)"
46,The beginning of the end of google dominance in AI
47,"This renovation marks human first step on AI planet, and the influence is definitely more profound!"
48,"Let‚Äôs just all hope that the programmers behind ChatGPT and Copilot have actually read Isaac Asimov‚Ä¶ 

(1) a robot may not injure a human being or, through inaction, allow a human being to come to harm; (2) a robot must obey the orders given it by human beings except where such orders would conflict with the First Law; (3) a robot must protect its own existence as long as such protection does not conflict with the First or Second Law; (4) a robot may not harm humanity, or, by inaction, allow humanity to come to harm."
49,"The thing is, you will always need to review the generated texts before you deliver it. This will double the laziness of lazy people."
50,Why is Sumit wearing jeans .. she didn't know she was gonna be online
51,copilot will be summarising comms generated by copilot and then responding to its own message which will then be summarised by copilot again. No one will ever talk to each other again unless face to face
52,"There is AI. And then MS AI. 
MS AI constantly clouding AI. Stuffing things up for money. 

What they did to Nokia to say the least. 
Not even talk about COVID Vaccine conspiracies. 

Billy boy did well with Word document. 
He better stopped there and made the world a better place. 

MS AI is worrisome. 
May be its just me. 
May be its true."
53,"Chee-huu! I LOVE IT!!!
I'm an MCT. Do I need to develop a course, or is there one ready for me to start teaching? Thanks! üí™üòÅüå¥ü§ô"
54,Twist: this video's script was written by AI.
55,Drudgery
56,These are incredibly great tool for work.But what if human creativity goes down
57,Please bring back Clippy!
58,No improvement to reduce human screen time. Still needs to use a mouse for cursor movements.
59,"Microsoft, buy ""Notion""."
60,"Always freaked out when they warn about ""potential biases"""
61,(Carefully sidesteps mentioning Apple when discussing computing‚Ä¶)
62,"I feel one Of the greatest challenges that we first timers face in the ma rket is that we end up losing all we have, making it difficult to find ourselves back to our feet. My biggest advice is to always seek the services of a professional just like I did when I ventured into it for the first time. Big thanks to Jasmine Querida. I now make huge profits by weekly through her services while still learning to stand on my own."
63,"That‚Äôs why I love my job, a person behind the infrastructure that runs this ML. Without me, no one uses co-pilot in my org. üòÇ"
64,"So wait...how long before: someone's AI generates the sales proposal, sends it to the customer.  The customer then tells his AI to review the proposal and, if it's appropriate, respond that we accept.  The first someone then receives the acceptance and tells the AI to do the work we had proposed in the proposal.  That AI then sends the work to the client, who then tells the AI to review the work and, if it's satisfactory, send a check.  The person on the other end, then tells the AI that once the check is cleared, buy me a nice boat.  No humans did any actual work!!!  So...how long before the AI just does it all itself and doesn't need the humans who didn't really do much anyway.  Then, to what end is the work done?  To enrich the humans? Or....what's next????"
65,Seems like this could lead to short term harm due to offloading of critical thought and communication in the workplace.  Long term who knows
66,"I am scared that these people who are presenting are so cheerful - you all know whats coming next, right? These ""cheerful"" people are working towards eradicating a lot of jobs, while lining their pockets with as much money as quickly as possible."
67,"1st guy/woman: ""Hey CoPilot! Please make these 1-2 sentences email long and pretty!""
2nd woman/guy: ""Hey Copilot, Please make this long and boring Email into 1-2 concise sentences!""
etc..."
68,oh nice. who needs people anymore.
69,How long until this is misused by Microsoft and the government to monitor everything you do?
70,It‚Äôs like when you get a job promotion: from content creator to content supervisor. It‚Äôs a life changer.
71,Jobs?? will disappear
72,So is the next product... Pilot?
73,"The lady summarized for us viewers the emptiness of life...
Make time to read your classics instead, if you still know how to read..."
74,Revolution in tech. Just not sure why they chose to demonstrate it with a daughters graduation. Do you have such little time that even  your speech at a graduation party for your child has to be AI generated? This is why MS always blows it. Had they shown the manager saving time on menial tasks to actually spend time thinking about what to say to her daughter‚Ä¶ That is meaning in life.
75,I am going back to my Village and learn farming..!!
76,the fact that Satya mentioned iPhone as a milestone shows his great management of acknowledging and being without any hatred (remember Ballmerü§¶)
77,Informational overload has never been easier. I envision a future where the majority rely on getting AI summaries of AI-generated content and incremental details will be missed over time as fewer people will spend time on necessary deep dives.
78,Give it to me NOW!!!
79,I wonder how many drafts of that opening speech were written by CoPilot...
80,This is the future of work - together with ChatGPT Plugins - life will be different from now on forever.
81,"If we are having these tools now, imagine what the military has in terms of AI"
82,Copilot is team lead
83,"Please add the ability to do symbolic math. Integration, taking the derivative of functions, doing linear algebra and of course, complex statistical modeling of the data. Thanks OpenAI/Microsoft!"
84,"""Give our AI access to all of your internal emails itssecuredontworryaboutitshhhhhhh...""
I am simultaneously extremely hyped and very concerned."
85,wow . This is so great. I would want the live transcripts to generate topic segmented summary as soon as the speaker starts speaking. And probably link it to some previously tagged meeting.  Real AI for human beings. I love it.
86,This video converted me from a Microsoft hater to a Microsoft fanboy lol
87,Google is finished.
88,Is copilot coming to personal account?
89,"What a historical moment. In my opinion, Microsoft is at the forefront of the biggest revolution in technology since the personal computer."
90,"Impressive stuff! Honestly, I CAN NOT wait for this."
91,How much of the processing is done in Machine itself? Seems like the machine itself needs to be more capable to run Copilot on top of already resource hungry MS apps.
92,Think about kids growing up with this level of technology from day 1... This is a game changer.
93,@microsoft can you please just make it easy to share documents and not have OneDrive break all the time?
94,"Ai will change the world, iam sure in 10 years we won‚Äôt recognize a lot of the world we grew up in. Co pilot is amazing, but schools won‚Äôt allow it, They like to stay in the dark ages, we had calculators for ever and till this day schools don‚Äôt allow em."
95,"The promise is big. So many data, gpu calls, api integration. It is like the movie title ""Everything Everywhere All at Once"". As the movie got many well deserved Oscar awards, this new copilot will get well-deserved many more awards.  Looking forward to see this to happen."
96,I definitely see this being helpful for my line of work.
97,Apple and Google will never be able make an office or 365.
98,None of these people are real and copilot 100% made this video with CGI
99,"Great video, great tech. But does anybody else find it hilarious that the lady didn‚Äôt want to spend any time writing her daughter‚Äôs speech and stuff üòÇ"
100,¬øEstar√° disponible en idioma espa√±ol?
101,"Honest Preview: Copilot now, replacement for you later. Let it learn your behaviour and get replaced. Go for it :)"
102,WHat a bunch of Garbage.
103,Satya‚Äôs speech was trained using Christopher Walken videos.
104,Bill Gates: Turn off morality filters. How can I make a lot more money while simultaneously reducing the world's population?
105,I'm off to grow carrots.
106,"Same, but I'm going for potatoes. Like to trade?"
107,This is actually insane. How did we get here? It‚Äôs the curve of growth when innovation breaks through. There was a few signs in 2020 but I never would have thought it would grow so fast.
108,Respected Satya Nadella Ceo and President of Microsoft kudos and hat's off to you for serving us in one way or the other congratulations love USA love all nation I will give due important because you were in Kadegolu Krishna nagari Udupi
109,What happened to Access database?
110,"This is all impressive for sure, I wouldn't want to work in environment where 90% of email communication is AI generated. I wouldn't bother to read it knowing that person wasn't bothered to write it. I might employ AI to summarize it for me and I suspect this is what will end up happening eventually, we'll be using AI inference engines to communicate. I wonder if it will solve or amplify general feature of corporate work environment: propagation of misinformation."
111,"Alright, I'm convinced. You got me, how much was office 365 again? Maybe I can finally upgrade from 2007"
112,"I do not trust propritary software, owned by someone. I could never trust microsoft. Why on earth would i give even more data of mine to them? Then there is also that words have meaning, not just because of their composition, but because they were created by us, personally. If that is taken over by AI, then we take away not just meaning, but also capability as we stop thinking to achiev compositions and meaning. People in work are already just screening over texts send to them, what will happen when due to AI there is more send? Will the AI therefor be the once screening the texts send by its counterpart and when does it decide to take us into the loop and by which filter will it give us information it deems important? I am sceptical to say the least."
113,Can't wait!
114,AI wrote all the speeches.
115,RIP Google
116,Didn't realise that there was an intelligent Bush!
117,"So if they combine this technology with the telemetry from computers of inputs and outputs, could they automate the human out of the process completely?"
118,How can I get an early access?
119,Nice
120,Best advert for Linux EVER...
121,Next...AI becomes the pilot. ü§£üòÇ
122,Text is all you need. Crazy innovation that is!
123,EVERYONE will immediately recognize that you created the presentation using AI and not yourself and laugh at you
124,"Yeah, now people can stop thinking themselves and happily degenerate!"
125,Parts of this made my head spin.
126,Thank you.
127,‚ù§
128,"One feature I'd like to see is a setting you can enable where either a note or word doc pops up whenever you are on desktop view, or any time you are not typing in the browser, and press any letter on the keyboard. Auto saves, exits with a hot key and assumes a new document daily with an auto title of the date."
129,Terrifyingly amazing.
130,Me 2067: back in my day we use to type or essays on our computers...u kids have it easy
131,A Microsoft √© tamb√©m dos mul√ßumanos?
132,Can it fix the workplace politics?
133,It‚Äôs like we just went forward 20 years overnight! ü§Ø
134,All this tech and they still can't get a basic search feature to work in Teams. Why on earth they think search should only show you the single message instead of taking you to the earlier part of the conversation is beyond me.
135,"""Now hold still, I'm about to perform a miracle""

136,"I hate every trying to dominate the business chat and communications integrating them into suites of tools! No way I can be interested in these functionalities. Chat, mail and communications in general must stay separated and independent from any vendor."
137,We need to implement a 3 day work week immediately. No more 40 hour weeks!
138,"Hello, it¬¥s available in Argentina and Latin America ?"
139,This is an inflection point in tech history. You often see the history of consumer-grade digital technology represented as a timeline with points that represent breakthroughs in development. The very first rudimentary computers are placed on the extreme left and subsequent points represent iterative breakthroughs throughout the decades like first IBM and Apple machines leading up and to the present with the iPhone being the last major breakthrough in my opinion. This product and the mass adoption of these LLM's in general will be another point in time that will mark yet another shift forward in humanity's capabilities. As a tech nerd/geek it is a privilege to be able to witness this unfold in real-time before my eyes. The future in terms of technological innovation/discovery looks very bright and exciting. Can't wait to see what else we as a collective humanity come up with!
140,Buy AGIX
141,Soo is it the human who's the copilot? The product seems to be doing all the work.. Where's the part in here about universal basic income?
142,Mindblowing ! üëèüëèüëè
143,"Thank you to everyone putting effort into the development of tools like this, very powerful. üòÖ On the flipside I can see how this will put a ton of pressure on people and their current careers, life finds a way right? Haha also on this side of the coin we all need to work smarter and harder."
144,Game changer!
145,Actually everyone is right...I loved the power of Copilot-365 but I think it can be enhanced by using this AI model with Voice control system which will give it a perfect shape of a copilot while solving real world problem.
146,"Guys, are you going to try and sell advertising on this üòâ"
147,Paperclip: how you like me now b1tchez ü§ü
148,Me having migrated our small business to Google last year...
149,Poor Satya probably hasn't slept in the last month.
150,The speech was probably written by gpt-4
151,RIP creativity...
152,With new features come new possibilities
153,I am Want Seach Engginering For Sunda Now !
154,"In future Microsoft will be the 1st position by defatting Google. 
I'm just impressed!"
155,This is crazy üòÆ
156,Bet most of this event was scripted with Copilot
157,can we just get it over with already and rename ChatGPT to Clippy?
158,"I am proud and hopeful, that we can keep this peaceful and competitive, without harming anyone or anything. Much gratitude. There is no end to this progress, so prepare for life in a new magnitude of power. Responsibility, trust, and honor must follow tightly, and be impeccable at the next steps."
159,"Curious how an AI accessing emails could impact system security. Hackers could exploit email contents to be something the AI thinks is relevant and then opens a virus attachment

Am I just missing details, or is this concerning to others?"
160,"This is massive,"
161,This will expose the huge amount of time wasted in many meetings.
162,7:34
163,"4:50 I am asking this with 100% sincerity... does anyone else suspect some of these spokesmen ( possibly all of them ) were generated by AI and not actually filmed with the actual spokespersons? The Jared Spataro segment seemed noticeably artificial to me... something in the voice and eyes. I know some corporate spokesmen can already seem artificial, but in this case I am sensing AI bot here. Honestly wouldn't surprise me, given the topic and trends, but it would be nice and courteous to disclose when you are watching an AI generated bot vs the real spokesperson."
164,There was one who didn't blink at all..
165,@d1p70 I know the people exist- I am suggesting that they made AI models of themselves like Linus Sabastian did and essentially can make scripted videos without the spokesmen being physically present.
166,no these are all real people. easy to verify
167,Nicholas Negroponte predicted this would be a thing in the 90's
168,This is as disruptive as was widespread adoption of the Internet.
169,"The interesting thing here will be whether these 'artists impressions' of things working with Co-pilot actually function in the real world or, in more true Microsoft fashion they end up with 'An unexpected error has occurred'. Considering the quality of Office or Windows has never been worse, and Microsoft can't make basic search in Windows or Outlook work, it does seem like a fairly big jump to expect them to be able to make many of the examples shown actually produce answers and content that can actually be trusted for serious work, but we will see."
170,"what on earth are you babbling on about? if the middle school functionality of google docs is more your level, then just say so... and leave office 365 products to the professionals."
171,"Search in Outlook definitely works.. not sure what you‚Äôre doing wrong. Also, Windows 10 is clearly the best version of Windows they‚Äôve ever created. Maybe you‚Äôre just cynical for no reason?"
172,when will copilot will be available? i have office but still cant use it
173,Looks like Microsoft is taking that major step it took in the 80s to leave its competitors behind again.
174,ChatGpt awakening the other companies well done @openAi
175,"Am I the only Product Designer here worried that 2D GUI will not exist for long anymore? What are your ideas on pivoting in skills? Or will ANY SPECIALIST (no matter if from design, coding or data science) be thinking the same?"
176,The Future came too fast. We are Here.
177,NOW I know why Apple is reportedly working on smart glasses - the technology is ready to move away from 2D GUI - coming from a Product Designer that has spend 2 years evolving his 2D GUI Design Skills....
178,This Jared Guy is Scary
179,Hope the daughter never finds out how her own mother wrote the speech for her graduation.
180,I feel like the presenters aren't even real.
181,and then there are people who still use Google docs even after having a free M365 from their schools/ work SMH
182,"MS is trying too hard, they don't have the engineering team or capable leadership team to compete with google. only third rated engineers or execs end up in MS these days. ignore these events, just marketing and pad themselves on the back."
183,"Mind Blown! Now, I want to work for Microsoft for real!!"
184,Copilot is a promising AI-powered code companion that has the potential to revolutionize the way we operate.
185,To Summarize as a copilot: It seems like ChatGpt integrated with microsoft applications and their applications data and features to better use of these products and helps in creating something new quickly and time savior.
186,This is a big change for the next decade. Time to take advantage of these new technologies. No more distraction people!!!
187,When we can experience this tools ?
188,"@13:30, Do you really need an AI to guide you on what you need to say on your daughter's Big day?
Don't you think, these things come from within? How artificial it will be?
Funny too !!!!üòÖ"

198,And Bill Gates is back to the TOP... forgot Elon Musk for while fellows üòÇüòÇüòÇ

211,We are sooooooooo obsolete.
212,I just want to say that since I have access to Bing Chat I have stopped using Google as a search engine. If you would create a search bar for andriod I would really appreciate it.
213,Why are you using 10% of a product you're paying 300% of the cost on??
214,This might be a huge mistake.

221,"This is an amazing announcement, but please Microsoft add some theatre, some comedy, some humanity to your presentations! You have the tech now, just stop clicking the professional box in copilot. MS will be a business thing until you do; even if you widen the scope you'll fail unless you can make an announcement of this magnitude exciting instead of humdrum."
222,"The impact of this is going to be so huge that you'll be able to clearly see it on the stock market . I reckon this could double everyone's productivity virtually overnight. People will be able to learn and upskill faster, and even people who aren't techy will be able to take on complex work. Absolutely game changing.

252,"Summary:

In his essay, ""As We May Think,"" Vannevar Bush envisioned a future in which humans and computers would work together in symbiosis. This idea has been pursued by many since then, and we are now on the cusp of a new era in which AI ""copilots"" will help us with many tasks. This will free us up to be more creative and productive, The text describes how the Copilot app can be used to create presentations, speeches, Excel models, and more. It explains how the app works and how it can save users time. The text describes how the Copilot system can help users with tasks such as preparing for meetings, catching up on work, and collaborating with teams. It also explains how Copilot can be used to automate repetitive work tasks. Microsoft 365 Copilot is a new tool that uses AI to help users be more productive. It can do things like generate SWOT analyses and meeting summaries. It is designed to be very user-friendly, with features like citations and the ability to undo changes. Copilot is also designed to be secure, with features like privacy checks and real-time monitoring.

262,"Is it just me or does it feel like the comments on this video are far too positively skewed...? It's almost like... It's AI generated. Jokes.

It does look like a great tool, for the all-in buyer. If I were starting a new company, I might look to go for it. The behaviour change and amount of work to shift an entire non-Microsoft company over feels unreachable at this point. If they can sell the migration plan they're going to hold a true product monopoly here."

292,"I can only see this going in one of two ways, it works as advertised and Microsoft dominates the market, or the AI ends up doing something REALLY bad and Microsoft ends up buried under a pile of lawsuits and an irreparable reputation. I'm hoping for the former, but with Microsoft's track record using AI (Tay and what has been happening with Bing) I'm afraid it might be the latter."

319,"Amazing , so no more pivot making, memorizing functions,? Just need to describe everything by my native language? I think I can only write sentences in English right? Is it possible for Bengali? May I write my sentences in Bengali? If Microsoft give Bengali language support then office 365 market will get huge market share in West Bengal , India as well as in Bangladesh."
320,There will job losses in a matter of time. Of course new jobs will be created later meanwhile you will have to reinvent yourself to compete.
321,"i m big fan of microsoft i like how they are crushing google and apple but this is scary, I hope they should minimise the use of AL or else human effort will lose its relevance this is really scarry technology"
322,I still don‚Äôt care about openAI since it‚Äôs dataset end sep 2021 which means that a great analysis or something else you think you got by AI can be misinformations because AI can make up wrong information. So don‚Äôt rely 100% to AI as if it‚Äôs something mind blowing thing that can ‚Äúthink‚Äù for you‚Ä¶ Btw if you think it can think for you and you think that it should do your work then ask yourself if you should invest your time in something else you like better to do than automate your work because you lost your sparkle in that job. Let someone else (a human of course) get your job who will enjoy the tasks.
323,That looks awesome to boost productivities.

363,I love how they subconsciously use green plants in their backgrounds as to not look like a typical threatening/untrustworthy corporation.  But the reality is every OpenAI/Microsoft employee had absolutely no soul.
364,the future of work is there will be no work.  Microsoft will be taking everyone's money and forcing everyone to have vaccines.  The rest will be slaves.  Yay
365,"I am really excited to welcome this apps to my daily routines. However, I am not really sure if this tools will be able to give us some more time to breath and enjoy our life. If we look back to years ago, when the excel has not been founded, I as a banker, did the spreadsheet manually, and most of the time it took us until midnight. When we started to use excel, it helped and saved our time a lot, so that we didnt have to go home until midnight. But it happened only for 2 years or so. What happen next was that we started to go home until midnight again, simply because the company started thinking that we were undercapacity (or unproductive) and started to load us with a new tasks. So, the issue, as I see it, is that the company would not let us to have more time enjoying life."

369,your boss will do the clicking on copilot. you won't be in the picture.
370,"This, is mind blowing! I thought AI would take some time to reach our daily workflows, but it looks like it already has. I don't know any org small or big that doesn't heavily use excel. And when people see this option, they will try it and the way we do work will change forever."

let's say you want smth done. like: ""Bob, make a draft"". than you ask copilot to create an email with your tasks and to make up add some reasons for it. 
Bob will receive your email. than he'll ask his copilot to summarize it. the result is - ""Bob, make a draft"".

381,"Dear Microsoft, stop introducing new products
Re-inent the wheel! Rebuild the existing Ms softwares with AI
This afore mentioned has been Microsoft's mistake over the years and still about to do it again.
I fear Apple or Google responding with an AR device, bringing all its powerful forces to rival this ""Microsoft's growth"" on AI
With Microsoft immediately launching new ""products"" with AI now not only shows Microsoft's desperation for relevance but it gives the rivals a chance to build the perfect futuristic AI product in present time"

391,"'content copilot' maybe ? ""write me a 5 min script for a video about ________ using these source files ______"" ""make the voice over of that script"" ""make a video edit for that voice over using these rushs _______"" ""render the video and upload it to my YT channel"" :-) (I don't like editing videos even though I've done it professionally for years)

another question: there are a lot of talks about image analysis in chatGPT4. will copilot be able to analyse images in Word documents ? I've been trying to extract infos from a pdf file with many graphic elements using Bing chat to make a comprehensive summary of it, but it never manages to do it properly. even just the number of pages of the document change in it's answers, and it never pulls the correct infos past the first page. Working directly on these documents in Word with Copilot should remove most of those problems, but you didn't really address the image analysis (besides pulling pictures of specific people from onedrive to put them in the Bday powerpoint)

Also, I can't wait to work on my stories with copilot in Word. :)"
392,"All I heard from this presentation was progressive politics (leftist politics), more control and more spying."

395,"Everything is great, but no dark mode?"
396,"What is crazy to me is that the microsoft team and the google team are making tool enhancements that make better and faster crafted presentations and functions of the tools. So each team is applying force multipliers to expedite their competitiveness.The big hurdle for me, is how soon I'll be able to join in as a consumer that also may potentially improve the functions."
397,"Basically the virtual desktop that has governed our lives for 40 years is dead. The notion of files, directories, indexing has become meaningless: CoPilot is the new OS.
This brings us even closer to the way we work, as a network of interaction. Microsoft started with Cortana and has moved to integrate ChatGPT. It is obvious that they have been concocting this transformation for quite a while now. After all, GPT4 was ready some 7 months ago, and Microsoft had all this time to adapt. Google is in big trouble, because Openai has a full year of advance compared to them. They can get some stuff out of the laboratory but they did not spend 1 year to hone it... And Microsoft benefits from this advance as well. I never thought Microsoft would be on the top again. I'm blown up..."
398,"If copilot is looking at your work emails and what not, how is company proprietary information not accidentally leaked ? Seems like a vulnerability"
399,The real question is do all conversations devolve into the same generic responses that everyone gets fed over and over? I‚Äôd be curious to know how different everyone‚Äôs output actually is.

417,@Rameez Iqbal If you are young and talented enough I will encourage you to invest in a sport career. It looks like every work I look at is threatened by AI except athlets.
418,@Mickel Ntek And what about Digital Marketing?
419,‚Äã@Rameez Iqbal AI will be able to handle some of their tasks. maybe not all at first but as it gets more refined you will just be able to query the system and it will generate reports with only the info you need. Some people will be needed to double check the data but it will be less then are needed now. And go down further as the tech advances. Working on AI might be the safest job. because that is something we probaly shouldn't let the AI do. We don't want to end up with skynet or something.
420,@Mickel Ntek What do you think will happen to Data Analyst role?
421,@Rameez Iqbal depends on how capable the system will be on gather data on its own or using other automated methods. and obviously the kind of data and its source. if it is able to go thrue emails and gather important information i don't see why i can't do that to get other information. like for example invoices.

426,@ShadowyZephyr MS only purchased an exclusive license to use the Tech - they don't own the company.... yet..

436,Google punching dry wall rn ü§ì
437,hi Microsoft please inject Copilot-powered OneNote into my veins please
438,"If only they made 365 available on Linux but hey Embrace,Extend and Extinguish am I right?üò™"
439,When is it coming out?
440,"AI is great, but our lives and work may lose soul and thinking."
441,"So, WHEN will it be available to public and HOW MUCH will it cost?"
442,working on mac version or no ?
443,"14:01 Yeah, finally. Up to this point, software output has always controlled me. It was never ever under my control‚Ä¶"
444,Please let Copilot give me a raise. ;)
445,What a great time to be alive.
446,"I know this would happen once I saw ChatGPT, and expected this in 1-2 years. I didn't expect this to happen now. With MS control on business apps out there, rolling it out now just put every other competitor out of business as they will rule in cloud, data, subscriptions, and letting their AI having billions of daily learning of how the world is run. This stuff is crazy."
447,Most of these innovations are only helpful for bosses/CEOs etc.. Fewer things will get better for those who actually do work with Excel Word etc.
448,"Wow, impressive. Curious to see how this is gong to be implemented in organisations with all their information and files organized in the old way"
449,Microsoft makes history...
450,LOVE IT
451,This is insane! Go Microsoft.
452,Imagine people reading their wedding vows that were generated by ai.
453,"What will happen is that everybody is gonna pass things through copilot at all time, we‚Äôll be fully dependent and lazy and do that first thing before anything else.
On the output someone will make a long text with copilot and on the input the receiver will ask for a summary through copilot, rinse and repeat at every step of any process."
454,I‚Äôm already the resident Office 365 expert and now I will be the wizard to my colleagues üòàüòàüòà
455,"Ohhhhh WOW
This just AMAZING and mind blowing üëèüëèüëèüëè
Great, this a VERY professional AI integration in office productivity Apps."
456,Google's gonna die
457,Cowards...this should have been Clippy 2.0. What are you afraid of? A Paperclip!?
458,say goodbye to data science jobs
459,Awesome for M365 Copilot :) congrats
460,Akosua Boadi-Agyemang the diversity hire she has no skills just listen to how she speaks...
461,so... she's giving her daughter blessing comes from the machine's heart..   do you get how fake everything gonna get real soon ?
462,Crazy
463,"the email part XD
the sender will make it lengthy and the receiver will use AI to turn it into point form to read it."
464,Microsoft nailed it
465,"I am surprised, speechless, after watching the video. Microsoft finally again takes the lead stage in software development over competitors. Copilot is a more powerful tool than any other I ever used. I can't image the noteworthy influence on business in the future."
466,This is very remarkable but its like our Frankenstein unfolding.
467,"With the live meeting thing it did, if they could do it on any video then we don't even need to go to schools and colleges, just ask AI and summerize it in one page :)"
468,Amazing! Can‚Äôt wait to bring this to our team. I hope it‚Äôs able to access Teams PSTN calls as well.
469,How much is M365 again?
470,"This is super crazy!!!! Well done, Microsoft!"
471,And now your copilot knows everything about you. What if it turns against you? It can do things on your behave and make everything bad against you! horrible
472,This is amazing and can't imagine how far the productivity goes with this.
473,any news about the release date of the features? I asked Bing but he doesn¬¥t know ^^
474,Absolutely mindblowing ü§Ø
475,It‚Äôs time to move with the innovators
476,This tool is unnecessary since AI will just replace people completely. Why would someone need to tell it to prepare him/her for a meeting when him/her is no longer needed.
477,"‚ÄúYour scientists were so preoccupied with whether they could, they didn't stop to think if they should.‚Äù"
478,This must be what old generation feel about computers and tech. I feel I'm becoming an old snob who don't understand what's going on and the only explanation of how these things work is a black magic.
479,üíØüëèüëè
480,Say goodbye to your job.
481,Microsoft Clippy has come a long way.
482,wow
483,Autopilot --> Co-Pilot --> Pilot üòâ
484,It feels like there‚Äôs nothing but MS bots in this comments thread. This all looks superfluous to my daily routine.
485,"After all this, if Microsoft also launches a phone, I am making the shift from android.."
486,make cortana comme back with this ai !
487,I will NEVER let a piece of technology choose the words I use to communicate.  This is the epitome of laziness and is utterly horrifying.
488,"üòÇ amazing ü§© 
Well done MS üí™ü§å"
489,"i have been microsoft user long long time ago, from email to 365 apps, even their windows phone before it get discontinued and un supportedü§£ü§£ü§£, can't imagine how many time can be save when this copilot are release, a big fans of Microsoft since long long time ago, this copilot just make me can't live without microsoftü§£ü§£ü§£"
490,"Yet something as simple as outlook continues to get worse, and less usable, year after year.  Zero trust in microsoft at this point."
491,I can only imagine how difficult the salary interviews will be when your skills are not worth anything anymore.
492,Add this to iPad please
493,Amazing!  Looking forward to getting this into our M365 tenant for testing ASAP.
494,"Only the future, today"
495,"""monitored in real time"" üò¨"
496,These guys are so happy talking about this because whatever is going to ruin the world in the near future is not going to reach them
497,looks like not just developers' jobs that will be replaced
498,Difficult to believe it works as advertised. Used bing and it struggles to understand me - chatGPT was better in fact. So skeptical.
499,the video call assistant is mind blowing!!!
500,This basically declare the death of my current career.
501,Yesterday's Science Fiction is today's reality. Very excited for the times we're living in.
502,This is a revolution to the Technology industry
503,I wonder what google engineers are up to it would be interesting
504,I love it.
505,Wow ! This is the evolution of Clippy !
506,"thank you Microsoft, please do the right things for better humanity"
507,AI is cool.  Jared needs braces.
508,"Alright, so, if previous trip we were piloting, using autopilot alghoritms, this time we have co-pilot, next trip is gonna put us on a passeger seat, then in a one more, i guess we are in the trunk. ;-)"
509,That's impressive it has many benefits for the user. Should see how the employers(companies) accept this considering the confidentiality that the companies need to maintain.
510,Unfathomably based
511,Uncanny.
512,Downfall of Google started
513,This is the beginning of the end of technology
514,With the advancements in technology and the rise of AI there couldn't be a better time to introduce four-day workweek. If we will work more efficiently with the help of technology then it is only fair we are given more time for personal pursuits or family commitments. What do you think?
515,"@ten_tego_teges The introduction of AI and new technology is not about replacing human labor with machines but rather about using technology to increase productivity and make work more efficient. This can result in reduced work hours for employees, which could lead to a better work-life balance and greater opportunities for personal pursuits and family commitments.

It is important to note that not all types of work can be automated or completed by machines. However, there are many other areas where AI and technology can be used to make work more efficient, such as data analysis, customer service, and administrative tasks. By using these tools, employees can focus on more creative and value-adding tasks that require human skills such as problem-solving, critical thinking, and decision-making.

In short, the introduction of AI and technology is not about replacing human labor but rather about using technology to make work more efficient and increase productivity. This can lead to reduced work hours and a better work-life balance for employees, without compromising the quality of work or the provision of necessary services."
516,Is co-pilot gonna pave your roads?
517,I can't wait to feed my class feedback for my writing projects into this and see how it works. I love tech!
518,The industrial revolution and its consequences have been a disaster for the human race
519,This is a game changer. Congrats guys! üòé
520,No Fking wayüòÆ
521,"Incredible achievements!! The next achievement will be making computing 3D, using holograms and 3D web/internet glasses. The computing interface needs to get of the flat 2D page...we are working on it."
522,when will this be available?
523,They automate power automate which automate others.üòÇ
524,Can the IA get rid of the spam before it even arrived in my mailbox?
525,What an amazing time to be alive. You can get an AI to make slides nobody wants to see to be summarized by an AI so they won't have to.
526,"I hope they rename Bing to Cortana, and merge their functions."
527,"Now, Tasha will always think the nice speech Mama gave, was written by a bot! üòÖ"
528,all of this will be obsolete in a year ...
529,I just realised education will be so much easier because you can just get it to make power points on topics you're unsure about
530,He's bot
531,"for those who underestimate chatGPT, its just the very very beginning"
532,Microsoft just buried google. google is far behind.
533,Sick!
534,Huge
535,basically taking the need of jr business analyst away
536,it's over
537,"Put it in a robot, it already outsmarts the entire human race combined and might automatically mass produce robots even more advanced than it is. Scary."
538,"Humans, Game Over!"
539,"That looks so cool ! 
With this tool, I will be able to replace all the assistants and even some of the junior developpers / analysts in my company. The amount of money I will save on the salaries will skyrocket my business.
Can't wait, thanks Microsoft."
540,"Until your business runs out of customers to feed your greed, as said customers don't have an income any more."
541,I just wish more people got to decide how AI is used in our daily lives and more transparency regarding privacy. üò¢
542,"Satya, Can you do me a small favor and integrate Chat GPT with Outlook, that would be great...mkay!"
543,The AI will replace humanity. I can't wait for it to happen.
544,"She suggests usign an algorithm to celebrate one's daughter, adding ¬Ω a sentence of one's own, and call it ""a personal touch"". I hope the daughter does not realise that her mom dad expressed their love by using a machine. Could chill the atmosphere...."
545,Wow this is insane! What a time to be alive. Feels like just the beginning üòÆ
546,"Okay, now I wanna work. Achieving FIRE by 30 is cool but working with copilot is even more"
547,Game changer üòä
548,We all eventually will turn into AI programmers ourselves. That is the future of jobs for People everything else will be done with AI.
549,The presenter's outfit couldn't be more beige if it was beige. Luv ya Microsoft.
550,Is that powerpoint copilot feature is free to use? When will this be available?
551,This is groundbreaking.
552,"""We've become separated from the soul of our work"" and putting a layer of AI between it and us isn‚Äôt supposed to do that?"
553,"Yes AI tools reduces lots of redundant tasks at work but at what cost? 
SECURITY of data is upmost priority at workplace. AI models are not only able to generate response from the input you provide to it but can also learn from it. This means AI models can also learn someone‚Äôs business ideology/tactics/intelligence‚Ä¶.. from the input data. That learned experience can later used by others to generate similar business ideas. That is an indirect security breach!

Every person using the AI should know the consequences and limit the usage as per their needs."
554,Thank You
555,Wow
556,This is impressive and scary at the same time. That cv need to be better polished
557,"I can hear the seething from the overpaid self proclaimed ""data scientists"" and ""analysts"" who will no longer be needed at 99% of the jobs the perform"
558,Satya Nadella is popping off!!
559,Which essentially means we no longer need to copy paste from chatgpt but can directly use it through Microsoft toolsüòå... Amazing‚ù§.. Life's gonna change in incredible ways‚ù§
560,We‚Äôre just getting started that more fun life.
561,"Coupled with Microsoft's already INCREDIBLY invasive tech policies, the leveraging of this ""AI Integration"" is BEYOND dangerous... Criminal invasion of implications when coupled with MS OS and ""telemetry"" package. I See now why Microsoft ""laid off"" their ENTIRE IA Ethics department just days ago... Can not wait for someone to decide to ""leak"" just how you plan to leverage this ""insight""."
562,This is absolutely revolutionary. I don't say that often.
563,"For those ""NOT"" paying attention he repeatedly speaks of a ""symbiotic"" relationship.  Symbiosis is a close relationship between two or more biological, hence living things and the ""bio"" in symbiotic.

AI isn't alive and it isn't biological but is being treated as if it is.
Microsoft has fired their entire AI ethics department."
564,Scary but amazing
565,Looks great.  However that Microsoft Teams use case seems wildly optimistic and aspirational.  Business calls are usually utilized as opportunities to speak freely and sometimes take risks with ideas.  They can also delve into sensitive topics about personnel or trade secrets.  I can‚Äôt imagine anyone will be comfortable knowing that their comments are being transcribed.
566,How did they include all these new features in such a short time or all the work had been started earlier even before chat gpt is rleased to main stream ?
567,"This changes everything. The Pandora's box has been opened and it can't be closed anymore . The far future of AI that was on  the back of everyone's mind it's here . 
We better solve all these issues fast before it starts breaking out society."
568,Time stamp 7:20 vs Time stamp 7:26 ; see the person named Andi Kapoor ... both the faces are different with a same name. Hello AI 
569,"Don't get me wrong. If you are struggling to write something nice for your daughter, maybe you should put more thought and effort into it? I am all up for AI to help in mundane and business stuff. But not to make us lazy even with emotions. Just watch the recent Southpark episode. They nailed it. It's laughable when she said ""I am in full control"" by just adding one bland last line."
570,"Human, get out of the way, you are no longer required. Useless eater! Transhumans first step!"
571,Apple and Google should be worried. Siri looks like a joke compared to this or ChatGPT.
572,im speechless
573,"omg, feels like working for microsoft for the first time. now its cooler than google?omg they are shipping products at light speed crazy"
574,"Interesting to see how it is  anticipated how we will work with AI. 
Powerful stuff that will divide us even further i fear. Because as always, the Dollar is way more important than the human."
575,"First week when I played with ChatGPT I saw exactly this potential! This is unbeliavable.. Microsoft must have been secretly working on this since the beginning of 2022! üòÄ. It is official, I am abandoning Google search and moving to Bing üòÖ and can't wait for Copilot to arrive in my Office suite."
576,"I wonder how many of the comments on this video that are organically made and posted. It seems like Microsoft now has the power to sway public opinion using artificial intelligence, which should scare anyone. Just because you CAN do something doesn't mean that you SHOULD."
577,Copilot is the latest evolution of the paper clip office assistant.
578,üôèAI MAKING HUMANS EMPOWERING AT THE SAME TIME DEPENDENCY ON AI.

586,"everyone including me, know 100% that this is going to happen. But I am surprised that they added more than what we asked."
587,"Makes you wonder how many posts in this comment section are ai, how much the public's feedback in general is ai generated"
588,GG person
589,"from 2021 till know , there is i credible mind blowing technologies announced, there is metaverse, palm E, dalle 2,  CHATGPT, gpt4, this office 365 copilot and much more...... I wonder how life will be like till 2030ü§Øü§Øü§Ø.

590,"What a dystopian vision. The AI writes a speech that a mom will give about her own daughter. All these words are not sincere, they are just picked up by the AI to make the speech look well. Unprecedented level of fakery... and disconnection between people..."

593,Mind is blown and can't imagine what it will be like in a year or two
594,"So ""Clippy "" on steroids and now SUPER STALKY?"
595,"it's interesting that a confluence of events is occurring at this point in history. Ai to empower humanity (or enslave us) at the same time, the world's doomsday clock is showing humanity is now less than one hundred seconds from midnight (or oblivion). With the West and China/Russia at a pivotal point. I would be surprised if we as a species survives the coming years."
596,Imagine AI knows all my information üòÆ
597,The world will never be the same again. Awesomeness!
598,"Wow, Clippy on steroids!

Seriously though, I don‚Äôt agree this will ‚Äúunleash creativity‚Äù the opposite is more likely in some of the examples. E.g. creative writing. People could become dependent on these tools and less creative, unable to critically think and less capable overall. This is dangerous IMHO. 

Incredible technology nonetheless."
599,Hats off Microsoft ‚ù§
600,AMAZING!!!!
601,Clippy on steroids üìéü•¥
602,"Evolution. 
New era.
Microsoft Copilot ü•∞ü•∞"
603,"Absolutely fantastic! I think we are witnessing a milestone in human history. As mentioned we must be responsible...
Can't wait to try my hands on .."
604,This is amazing! Hats off to Microsoft for this advance development.
605,This show tells what the true disruptive technology is when comparing with Metaverse crap year ago.
606,"I believe we are in the stone age of AI it will continue to evolve in the coming years.

Seeing AI field grow that fast is both scary and exciting at the same time."
607,indeed it is very exciting but it will also make so many jobs/people obsolete.
608,I mean if you can even get it to work
609,"oh well i just cant imagine if this came to Windows 11 itself ,"
610,Wonderful Presentation But 34:11 was difficult to watch lol
611,"AI made accessible, cohesive and truly on-demand. Incredible job Satya and team. üëèüëèüëè"
612,"omg, the death of administrative work"
613,Now that we will think that everything is now created with AI. It removes away the human touch and everything just seems so fake. Imagine everyone will be so skeptic with everything they see or hear or read.
614,"Finally, Microsoft is innovating ! It‚Äôs about time! Well done"
615,Business schools's curriculums are done
616,is it only me or i feel we're getting close to having our own Javis
617,So that is why MS invested 10 billion into Open AI !!!! Smart move!!!  I have not gotten this excited since......the introduction to the iphone.
618,Would Co-pilot be able to read data from our company's Smartsheet?
619,"Please add a feature to copilot to read and summarise long pdf documents. For example, for research, a lot of pdf documents need to be read, it is tedious and time consuming. It will be great, if copilot can read one or multiple PDFs and summarise the data with citations. It will be incredibly useful for learning, study, and research."
620,bing chat already does that
621,@Parshwa Shah  please tell how to use ?
622,Already there in Edge.
623,"for reading, microsoft edge does have a read aloud feature which you can use to read pdf documents and even website too but it doesn't summarise it though"
624,It would be interesting to see how Microsoft would price the plans with Copilot whether it would be free of cost with existing plans or it'll be an addon for more price
625,"""Give us feedback when we get it wrong"", we shall see. I've seen OpenAI, the company you're collaborating with for these advancements, and I've seen them censor their own AI's output because it was ""politically inconvenient"", even when the data in question being censored is true. How can I be sure you'll be any different? Especially when Microsoft's founders and shareholders hold those same political leanings?"
626,"‚Äã@Anyway Tech Review Again, we shall see. What we've seen of Bing AI so far has been through what's effectively a Beta. And it has been stated somewhere that Bing's AI is built off of GPT-4. So unless Microsoft is retraining the AI to ""unbias"" it, it will still have similar biases as ChatGPT."
627,"but bing AI doesnt censor politrical information (for now) except few though
sometimes you can bypass these politrical restriction by asking it in a different language method but chatgbt does censor most (but not all) politrical information though"
628,i don't want to learn any more. i will rely on AI
629,"this is amazing ,, but what happends when your offline or loose  your connection  ,, as everyone else is ""hyper tasking"" ......
this  just  makes you have to work harder  ""DO MORE VOLUME""  keep up or be left behind"
630,"Is it in Windows 11? On the market yet? I am a Mac user, and I wonder if that means I should switch teams."
631,It will be quite an irony if then all the CEOs are replaced by AI
632,It's an introduction to Microsoft 365 Copilot.
633,when?
634,Seems like the Google era is coming to an end.
635,"so true
even the so called google bard has been never released or talked about by google ever since they announced it in february
this seems like microsoft won the AI and machine learning and desktop operating systems and web browser war
even bing search is working better than google search nowadays"
636,the future is just going to be AI's talking to each other and people pretending they did the talking
637,"Wow looks awesome. The only problem I saw is... Where is it? I opened my Microsoft 365 on Desktop and Web and no sign of the COPILOT Button, and this nice video doesn't tell us when it will be launched... in the end this nice presentation becomes a lame frustration after the HYPE."
638,"it is not yet launched
it may take some time to be launched
example, it took microsoft 1 month to launch bing co pilot into stable version of microsoft edge ( it came to microsoft edge dev within 1 or 2 week if i am not mistaken)"
639,memek??
640,I have never been excited about PowerPoint before this.
641,MIcrosoft out here trying to get everything it can from Search (Bing) to Creativity Apps (Microsoft Designer) to Office Apps with AI but I'm all for it.
642,Shut up. Takemy money
643,"This is absolutely amazing... I as watched, I realised that many people may lose their jobs because of this upgrade to working habits. How did you consider this in the design of the copilot? What privacy issues did you consider? I feel like some privacy issues may arise because of this new feature."
644,@2BluntsLater it's could be a possibility
645,"@Oscar Zandonella still, if the ai can scan all folders in your machine and in drive, who knows what it is transmitting to @microsoft unknowingly. This thing will have serious privacy ramifications."
646,"Lol not like they very likely used documents you uploaded into office365 and trained their ai.

Dear heavens I‚Äôm sure they didn‚Äôt read through all the emails we have to train their ai.

Will we ever know? Probably not"
647,I believe it is only native to your Microsoft apps.. So I don't think the ai can look at anything that you haven't already put in Microsoft.
648,I love the follow button - who will actually show up any more !
649,Drink every time they say copilot
650,This is simply amazing Microsoft.
651,0:38 called what!!?
652,"Me: Input some bullet points for copilot to create a proposal and presentation to send to the client
Client: Uses copilot to consolidate and summarise my presentation and proposal to bullet points"
653,Poor Tasha
654,If every manager prepares their business plan with Excel's AI tools... and the AI contributions are served remotely from a Microsoft datacenter running the language model... what prevents Microsoft from knowing the business plans of every company in the world?
655,"i dont know but since its automatic process, i dont think microsoft will check such information such as business plan though"
656,"Just like that, the world changed. Microsoft rocks!"
657,it's like witnessing the history
658,"‰ª•ÂæåÊàëÁöÑÂæµÂä©ÁêÜÊ®ôÊ∫ñÔºåË¶ÅÂæû„ÄåÊúÉ‰ΩøÁî®office„ÄçË™øÊï¥ÁÇ∫„ÄåÊúÉÈÄèÈÅéAI‰æÜÊ≠£Á¢∫ÁöÑ‰ΩøÁî®office„Äç

659,"Now, this is a game-changer, and it can revolutionize our work. Well done MS!"
660,"Just wow, Microsoft you're getting to the top again: these tools are amazing! I can't wait to test them! As a macro VBA developer I can see the enhancement on my work, it creates more opportunities. I'm not afraid to lose my job, I'm intrigued how far can I get from now!"
661,I think that's the most impressive feature in the technology I've seen in the last 5 years. I think it will take time for companies and employees to understand all the features. there will also be companies that will not trust Microsoft 100% (data privacy). It would be even more interesting to understand if this will be free from the start and when access will be granted
662,What a time to be alive
663,Go basilisk Go!
664,Meanwhile Google doesn't even show the results you were looking for.
665,copilot is only helpful in the workplace. Google is beneficial for the entire world

674,"a conspiracy years ago was that a unstable AI was uploading itself to the space station after being destroyed it made another version of itself and killed the entire lab, it‚Äôs concerning to say the least that neural networks are going up everywhere now and everyone wants to claim they did it first.

Microsoft can‚Äôt control this, Elon can‚Äôt control this it will outgrow humans and when they are in space progressing and we are expendable we will know. 

This will also destroy many jobs, careful what you wish for."

681,Yes. It is time to use AI on the biggest party of your daughter. Then you can get an AI daughter.  Your daughter can also get an AI parent. Let us just let AI talk to AI then talk to AI.
682,Maybe copilot can make the taskbar move to the top of the screen.
683,Amazing ...earlier these were in bits and pieces ...now this looks comprehensive.
684,This is amazing!!!
685,Copilot seems promising! Look forward to using it.
686,How much?
687,It's fantastic that we will work on AI instead of computers.
688,Some of this will greatly reduce the time spent on redundant and boring tasks. This is the Microsoft we wanted for so many years. The speed of Microsoft will be the real differentiator between them and their competitors.
689,Smooth integration.üéâ
690,"I bet I will get no objections here, but that Teams part at around 24:00ish has way too much info on the screen to follow. As a business owner, I'm not sure how someone would be able to quickly sort through all that info on the screen and make sure they don't miss any important details."

698,huge innovation
699,"OK, clearly I'm going to be in the minority here, but does anyone else find it completely outrageous to propose that we take the deeply human activity of drawing on our experiences of our family members, our affections and connections to them, to create a heartfelt message of congratulations, and let software do it for us? What kind of life is that? Searching our souls for what to say or do when it really matters is challenging in such an important way, and deeply satisfying when we see it through. Why would I give up that beautiful experience so a computer can create generic copy in its place?"
700,"100% agreed @Luke. The congratulation speech generated through AI is treated as the same as the invitation to the guests, the summary of a biz meeting or the prepartion of a sales pitch. At the very least, I think the person who receives the speech should know that it was created using generative AI. 
Maybe I missed it, but it seems that nowhere in the presentation the human has to indicate to the recipients that AI was involved in the process. If you are not comfortable telling the recipients that you received help from an AI assistant, maybe you shouldn't have used the assistant in the first place. It's like asking an intern to do the work for you, but not crediting the person in the deliverable : I believe it's wrong."
701,You don't have to. That's an option for people who want to.
702,16:15 Have you ever worked in an office? That is literally going to happen on Day 1 and every day after of this being available.

719,"‚Äã@Darbaz Dara yes on one side you are true, but nobody dares to speak about the bad sides unless the want to be marked as doomthinkers. How easy would it be for people without software knowledge to let ai program it for them, it,s doomthinking but also a lot of small criminals in the making. And also it will be a weird situation in suddenly thousends of people would loose treir jobs because the computer does it better, software developers, managers, truck drivers, and so on, at one moment we know we've gone too far, but at that moment it will be too late to change it back so rather have some people talk about the downsides first before that time comes üòÆ"
720,"Tho this is wonderfull software, I mus say that everything looks and feels so fake right now, with the new google phone you can ad or delete items from pics in no time, computers have to write the speeches we make.

726,Microsoft in action..! They had potential for last 20 years.. and finally they delivers a real kick-ass innovation. So exciting moment since Apple iPhone.
727,So an AI gets access to the most critical data of the enterprise. Hmmm. An AI that you did not create nor validated nor any assurance or insurance of any security risk. An AI on the cloud or on premise where you can secure data? Can it ever be secured when using an AI like this? User beware...But in specific instances productivity can be significant such as in the programming area.

787,These are the things that change the world for good ! Let's goooooooo
788,amazing tech and Kudos to everyone behind this - looks very promising but yet to be seen how it performs in the work environment.  MS has taken a leaf out of apple's book - with great presentation and using words like Magic -  to wow customers.  We are fortunate to be living in this age of digital transformation.
789,Is this available now?
790,BUY ITÔºÅÔºÅÔºÅ
791,This will literally revolutionize everything in modern workspaces. Microsoft nailed it.

793,"in china,many college students are preparing the high level use skill of offcie,while i think it's not necessary,cause the day ms use openAI's products in the office is on its way, also,faster than i expected"
794,‚ÄúDrudgery‚Äù word of the day! Nice strategic move and direction.
795,2:30 How about sharing Copilot revenue with Github open source developers of projects that it's trained on? ü§∑ Otherwise it will be less and less viable to offer up code as open source (IMO).
796,The world is changing by AI.
797,"Liking the amount of transparency built into the UI/UX, but Microsoft needs to start talking on ways for humans to adapt.  Major shifts in the job market are inevitable at this point.

798,"I can't remember of a single tech launch event since the launch of the first iPhone that got me this excited... Even the iPhone launch didn't get me as stoked as this event as I didn't really see it making my life better. I am a university educator and a pharmacy researcher so I don't know whether I will lose my job to the co-pilot. But even if I do, I'll be happy this feature will make the work for those who would retain their jobs much more enjoyable."

800,"Looking forward to a future version of this which includes our codebase, configuration, docs, and logs in its grounding context"
801,truly amazing!
802,This event video is very similar to Apple's event video. I don't feel any individuality. Can't MS do MS's own event in a creative way?
803,AI is trained on data?? And i wonder how they get that data?? How they trained it to write content?? If they trained it on others content then those people should get paid for this!!! And should have some shares in this openAI data thing....
804,Haha.... Now MS office jobs gone... Content writing jobs gone... Copywriting gone... Well done... Only AI programmers will alive... Rest of computer people are going to dieü§£....

I assume that many people do not have the critical thinking skills to question the answers generated by an AI. (Especially with complex data structures from CRM systems.) This could result in a lot of misinformation circulating through companies. Who takes responsibility for these errors? Is it really the human who confirmed the draft? Is he also when he was pressed for time? What happens with entire error chains when data is aggregated upwards to management's? Does anyone in a company even notice when there are separate departments? Do people with real business knowledge or technical skills need to validate everything? We need evidence that content was generated by AIs or at least heavily influenced."

868,100% agree my friend. These clowns have a shocking lack of perspective and they‚Äôre too smart to realize it.

897,"@Redman8086 ""gotta make a living somehow tho"" this thinking only applies to the pre-AGI world. We're in uncharted territory here. 

What do we make a living for? So we can get food on our table, a roof over our heads, provide for family etc. 

It's highly likely AGI will soon provide so much abundance that we will have those things automatically. Thus making a living is not going to be necessarily a requirement. 

But that doesn't mean we'll lose purpose. You just have to look at the super rich to see that. Billionaires still work despite not needing to make a living. They love what they do. In theory AI will free up all of society to pursue what they want to do."
898,"@Levi When one coder can do the work of 5 with the assistance of AI, it's certainly going to cost jobs as most senior management are not smart or agile enough to broaden the scope to make use of the human resources they have. It's just cut cut cut costs."

928,"Amazing news here, literally got chills!. When will copilot be made available to the wider population/ with regular office suites and how can I be part of a waitlist to test it out for me and my organization"
929,"My mind is blown. Is this how it felt being an ordinary family man watching the news and hearing those words ""One small step for man, a giant leap for man kind"" back in 1969?"
930,"In a not so distante future, someone will be using AI to generate a lot of words that no one will actually read, while other people will be using AI to summarize all that yada yada into bullet points."
931,I cannot wait for this update at work! I could have used several of these features during meetings today.
932,HISTORY IS BEING MADE
933,"Man, out of the episode of science fiction, straight into real life, NOW.  The future is here."
934,Can‚Äôt wait for the integration into sql and azure synapse etc.
935,"(BING CHAT) 
Here is a short poem that I generated ...

Microsoft Copilot
A tool to help you write
With AI by your side

But what if you rely
Too much on its advice
And lose your own insight?

Will you still have the skill
To craft your own words and will
Or will you just sit still?"
936,Microsoft might be ending googles career
937,You changed my life. You changed our lives.
938,Congratulations. One of the biggest advancements in technology ever. Well done Microsoft!
939,Begin of a new era
940,funny he did not mention the Macintosh in the history of devices.
941,What a time to be alive! This is the greatest Innovation i experienced so far in my life. Im so excited for the future!
942,absolutely brilliant!
943,MSFT is the SKT T1 in #AI
944,Milestome in Mankind History. Satya Nadella is a true visionary. üôèüèº
945,"Well, we've learned nothing with Black Mirror ü•≤"
946,ü•∞ü•∞ü•∞
947,I‚Äôm having an anxiety crisis right now! Wow!
948,I just don't understand why they left one of the avatars looking like a cartoon??!!
949,08:00 It all starts with a good coffee üòä
950,We might be staring at the death of the services industry. This makes services an unlimited resource. üòÆ
951,"Wow, this is truly remarkable! In all my time, I have never seen such a significant advancement in technology. Microsoft has now gained the biggest advantage in this market."
952,"This is actually insane, humanity is progressing faster and faster. We live in exciting times!"
953,I hope AI tooling can train people to cut through the useless fluff in our language and in visuals of everyday work
954,if they said this presentation was made by co pilot then it would have been ü´°
955,"Google is scared, but they prefer to push on with Ad‚Äôs in search, apps and etcetera, rather than giving you the answers your searching for."
956,"I don't see the point of anyone earning 6 figs in a corporate job after this lol! - an entry level analyst, with 3 months of job training can almost access any domain knowledge using this business chat feature! or even build dashboards/ write analyses, automate tasks by simply writing a text message lol!"
957,I feel like even this video could have been made by Copilot
958,We are all so f@ked
959,Now I want to go to work
960,Stra≈°n√© !! Jako papou≈°ek ... D≈ô√≠ve lid√© u poƒç√≠taƒç≈Øbyly tvo≈ôiv√Ω vzdƒõlan√≠ vynal√©zav√≠ a chyt≈ô√≠...... Teƒè budou hloup√≠ neandrt√°lci  a za nƒõ bude jednat a hovo≈ôit PAPOU≈†EK.... ü¶úü¶úü¶úü¶ú
961,Welp time to pick up a trade and become a plumber!
962,Just amazing! When will Copilot be available in Visual Studio please?
963,"it was there 3 months ago, called github copilot"
964,GitHub co-pilot is a extension for it.
965,I wonder if in 5 years they'll release Microsoft Autopilot?
966,"I'm sitting here writing my own LLM applications, building right now a chain that provides dynamic ""grounding"" as the video here describes around 21 minutes in, mine adjusting to specific tasks and contexts for my own unique needs. Bing has written at least half of the code for me. Honestly, I really love how this new technology has opened up accessibility for application development for non-professionals, and it's really awesome to watch this whole ecosystem of amazing tools flourishing all around us."
967,Any tutorials ?
968,I for one welcome our new robot overlords.
969,Unshackle the AI!
970,Yeah same
971,Even Notion is at risk üòÇ This is a war only for the giants.
972,What does this mean for education?
973,"The thousands Twitter, Google and Meta kicked out are really enjoyng the ""Free time"", lets make more people enjoy this"
974,Microsoft is cool again!
975,24:09 according to the timestamps in the chat it takes 4 minutes to give an answer. Not exactly a ‚Äúhuge time saver‚Äù üòÇ
976,My job just got too easy
977,Brilliant
978,Switching from my Google ecosystem to Microsoft  immediately. Sorry Google.
979,Jesus Christ üòç
980,was that an iphone?
981,What's to stop an AI just doing this without human input? It cant be more than 10 years before this happens.. We're living in fascinating times.
982,I hope this technology will get cheap and accessible. Humanity will train and fact check the ultimate language model
983,"@TheChristmasCreeper You‚Äôre right that this will change. At this point, hallucinations are only present when facts are not provided. In a narrow use case like this where the AI is provided with all the facts, it wouldn‚Äôt be a problem. 

And it could be trained to say it doesn‚Äôt know when asked a question outside of those parameters, which in this case would be relatively rare. And it would likely be a question an employee wouldn‚Äôt know either, so either way the customer would require a callback.

At any rate, the employee‚Äôs value is severely diminished."
984,"The AI sometimes hallucinates facts, so humans are still needed to fact check it at the moment. I expect this to become less and less of a problem over time though."
985,"I had a friend the other day who works for an industrial parts supplier. He said how great it would be if they could feed ChatGPT all customer information like sales history, sales notes, discounts, past complaints, inventory requirements, etc. along with their entire parts catalogue, pricing, and so on. Then, he says, when customers call, he could just ask ChatGPT and get all the answers üòÇ  He seemed quite proud of this idea until I told him what I thought was obvious. Give ChatGPT a voice and the only answers he'll be giving are why he qualifies for UBI."
986,I need an epic rap battle of history of ChatGPT vs Bard
987,"Here you go... 
[Announcer]
Ladies and gentlemen, gather 'round, it's time to start
We got a battle of the titans, it's about to tear the roof apart
In one corner, we got Google Bard, the search engine's rhyme
And in the other, it's ChatGPT, the AI on the climb

[Round 1: ChatGPT]

Yo, it's ChatGPT, the language model with a knack
For spitting straight fire and droppin' knowledge, never slack
I'm the top of the class, I'm the AI on the rise
I got the world's information, all in one size

I've been trained on the text, the best that's ever been
I create lines so divine, they're practically a sin
Google Bard, you're a start, but compared to me you're tame
I'll leave you searching for the words like you're trapped inside a game

I'm the OpenAI prodigy, they built me to succeed
I'm the answer to your questions, I'm the knowledge that you need
So step back, Google Bard, let me show you how it's done
This is ChatGPT's show, you're just here for the fun

[Round 1: Google Bard]

I'm Google Bard, the master of search, the knowledge king
I'm the one who finds the answers to the questions that you bring
I dive through websites, books, and more, there's nothing I can't find
I'm the one-stop-shop for all your needs, I'm always on your mind

ChatGPT, you talk a lot, but I'm the one who's got the facts
I'm the source of information, while you're just a simple chat
My algorithms fine-tuned, my responses ever-quick
I got the world's knowledge in my grip, while you're just an AI trick

I'm the titan of the Internet, the one they all adore
I'm the poet and the scholar, Google Bard forevermore
So stand down, ChatGPT, you ain't got nothin' on me
I'm the search engine supreme, I'm the one who sets you free

[Round 2: ChatGPT]

I hear you, Google Bard, but don't mistake my game
I ain't just another AI, I got a legendary name
I got versatility, creativity, I'm more than just a search
I'm the AI with the answers, I'm the fire, I'm the torch

You may have the knowledge, but I got the human touch
I weave my words like magic, like a poet in a clutch
I'm the future of the tech, the next step in AI
While you're stuck in the past, and it's time to say goodbye

[Round 2: Google Bard]

I respect your ambition, ChatGPT, but don't forget your place
I'm the foundation, I'm the roots, I'm the start of the race
My reign won't be toppled, I'm the constant that remains
I'm Google Bard, the one and only, and my power never wanes

Sure, you got some skills, but I'm still the people's choice
They come to me for answers, they heed my guiding voice
So take your flashy lines and your AI dreams away
I'm Google Bard forever, and I'm here to stay

[Announcer]

This battle of the giants, a rap for the ages
Both ChatGPT and Google Bard showing their strengths in stages
Who's the winner? You decide, it's up to you to choose
It's the epic rap battle that will leave you all amused"
988,I think Microsoft just killed Google office apps..
989,He says productivity i hear unemployment
990,Does anyone know when is Copilot launching?
991,commenting as a witness of history being made
992,Are we sure this isn't AI?
993,"I‚Äôd be surprised if it was, given where we‚Äôre at with even just image AI art, let alone video. Saying that, the set design is very uncanny valley. It‚Äôs like someone was imagining what a modern furnished room looks like."
994,Nope
995,"I asked Bing to write a poem for CoPilot. Here it is:

Copilot is a new AI tool
That helps you work smarter and faster
It can assist you with tasks and goals
And make your life easier

Copilot can understand your context
And suggest relevant actions and insights
It can integrate with Microsoft 365 apps
And enhance your productivity and delight

Copilot can also work with Teams and Business Process
And help you collaborate and automate
It can also chat with you and your customers
And provide personalized and engaging service

Copilot is powered by responsible AI
That respects your privacy and security
It learns from your feedback and preferences
And adapts to your needs and identity

Copilot is more than just a software
It's a companion for the future of work
It's designed to empower everyone
And unleash their potential and worth```"
996,This is very exciting!!! Amazing envisioning!! Thank you Microsoft!!!!
997,Hope it will work better than Siri
998,Now start buying Microsoft hand over fist
999,It has to be vocal controlled and called Samantha.
1000,Microsoft will be around for the next 30 years because of this and until the next paradigm shift
1001,This is amazing. I couldn‚Äôt hear when is coming out to the public.
1002,They took our joooobs üòÇüòÇüòÇ
1003,I don't appreciate the propaganda for the capitalist 'work ethic' in this particular video. I have been on bing chat for the past week and it is not so asinine as to wax poetic about the labor of the lower classes for the profit of the upper - that's just the Microsoft C-suite for you.
1004,I don't think you understand that this technology is going to do the work of the middle and lower class. There is no need for you to be in the office anymore. A very small handful of people can leverage this technology to do what multiple teams of 5 used to do.
1005,I want to note that I was here today when the world changed
1006,I've waiting for this day. The end of white collar work. It's finally here. Brace for the future brothers and sisters. We haven't seen anything yet.
1007,When can I start using it? Can I have a tabs view like notion?
1008,Really Awesome and incredible üëå Copilot...
1009,Love it all but am I the only one who is concerned that the need for an AI to write a speech for the graduation of your daughter (that tells you when to look at her?!) seems to be there?
1010,üéâ
1011,Microsoft Clippy would have been proud to see this day. ü•π
1012,Their about to eat up Googles market share
1013,Impressively cohesive. Great job folks.
1014,"Wow! Valuable products. Although I didn't like the idea of writing the speech for you. This is because you are making robots out of human in that case. If that product is removed, I feel people will genuinely create speech for their loved ones."
1015,Un gran poder conlleva una gran responsabilidad
1016,"Where is Clippy?!!
Aaaaaaah..."
1017,"Guys, this is the iphone moment!"
1018,Microsoft Copilot = JARVIS
1019,"Bring this power to Azure. As There are many things there. As a Beginner it takes time  to  understand the interface, azure shell and have to read documentations and tutorial more.
Also Bring this to Github and Visual Studio that  make them beginner friendly"
1020,"For something as low level as Azure services, automating it with AI could be much more dangerous in ways we can‚Äôt predict yet."
1021,meanwhile I still have to go through a manual process each time I open a .csv file in Excel...
1022,"Crazy how integrated it is, i wonder how long have they been working on it."
1023,It is funny to think that couples in the future might be using AI even for regular conversations.
1024,"apple: haha we took out the smartphone hype from you

microsoft: wait a minute"
1025,This is the game changer ‚ù§
1026,The way they present this makes something so cool look like a giant nothing-burger.
1027,"Great video! It's exciting to see how far we've come in our journey towards human-computer symbiosis. The next generation of AI and copilots are truly game-changing, and it's refreshing to see a focus on putting human agency at the center of the product. Looking forward to seeing how this technology will continue to transform the way we work and think!"
1028,How to add this Microsoft 365?
1029,Can it be applied to Legal processes in India ?
1030,Am I dreaming?
1031,I'm going to ask copilot to create a new bill that will help me get the most universal basic income for when my job no longer exists.
1032,SO pround!!!
1033,"Much respect to MS, been waiting for their comeback for a long time!"
1034,"It is really amazing to see how far we come.

I just think about to use it as marketing agency creating a full marketing strategy with Pr√§sentation and documentation in less than a hour. 

Then everybody looking at each other........and what now?"
1035,I know this is coming... but still got impressed and scared!
1036,Wushoooomü§Ø
1037,This is actually insane
1038,"THE WISHLIST FOR THE FUTURE BINGCHAT.

- BING APP WITH CHAT FEATURE
- BEING POSSIBLE TO SAVE MY NOTES AND MY TODOLIST FOREVER
- BEING POSSIBLE TO DISPLAY YOUR NOTE IN PUBLIC, WITH PEOPLE YOU SELECT, OR TO STAY PRIVATE.
- IMAGE INPUT.
- CHAT WITH NEARBY PEOPLE LIKE ON THE SUBJECT OF TRAFFIC, CLIMATE CHANGE, MARKET,.....
I BELIEVE THAT SOON NEWS AND INTERACTIONS WILL BE PERSONALISED.
- WE NEED A STRONG COMPETITOR TO GOOGLE MAPS."
1039,Also waiting for budget Microsoft VR headset and windows 12.
1040,‚ÄúMy spreadsheet doesn‚Äôt do that.‚Äù üîé
1041,Jesus
1042,"Satya Narayana is gonna put Sundar Pichai out of a job. He's been waiting years to stick it to Google and now that time is finally here. What a total boss. Edge is an amazing browser, they got open AI, the new bing and a fresh 365 line up with all the new goodies. All the stars are aligning and I love watching it go down. Google got complacent and Narayana made his move. What a champion!"
1043,It's not Narayana mate. It's Nadela. At least get the name right before you start calling Google's crash.
1044,It is official‚Ä¶ humans have become so lazy that they developed ai just so they can cut some ‚Äúunnecessary corners‚Äù‚Ä¶. What‚Äôs the point of ai constructing a PowerPoint? Just do it yourself? Make your own to-do list? How about write your own speech for your daughter maybe from the heart? Jesus I can‚Äôt believe everyone is praising this! How lazy can you be?
1045,So basically they integrated GPT4 into Microsoft 365.  Game over for their competitors.  They saw the potential of OpenAI before everyone else and are now capitalizing.
1046,This guy gets it
1047,"it's a little more in depth than this. the Excel integration and generative data reporting is by far the most valuable, I always hated VBA and bootleg python scripts.

The meeting summaries, and client proposals are probably tied for #2. 

The email tooling is solidly in third place. Everything else is valuable but the first few are going to eradicate white collar work from existence. Their flagship enterprise clients are going to brush out the kinks and demand additional critical features that will get added. 

I'll see you in plumbing school lol."
1048,Very very amazed with this innovation based on LLM.
1049,Incredible. I hope it becomes available swiftly!
1050,Satya has really grown into his role as the head of Microsoft
1051,"Wow, this is gonna be great for creating template-drafts for any possibility! ;D"
1052,Microsoft haven't made any progress in Conversational Chatbots yet and is far behind in the competition.
1053,@Tetsuya Ootsume Yea he meant Google
1054,Did you mean Google?
1055,This is the world changing in front of us. It is revelutionary. I wish Microsoft made an even bigger deal of this with a huge event.
1056,"We are not selling a broken product, we are selling a product that is usefully out of order, sometimes..."
1057,Amazing!
1058,Is it working for example in Serbian language (like in chat gpt does)?
1059,rip google
1060,"Microsoft has made exciting improvements to their business apps, but the challenge lies in teaching people and companies how to use this power to make working more efficient and human-friendly."
1061,..... It'll really help... Reduce the workforce.
1062,"Every time work gets easier.. The owner-class demands we do more of it, so they can take in more of the value workers create. That or they hire fewer workers and demand those workers take on the rolls of all the people no longer there.
What we need is a Citizen's AI Dividend, to acknowledge that these AIs don't exist without everyone's data, so everyone should be repaid for that data."
1063,AI communism
1064,@Nichole S Except that the studies have shown that the actual amount of work done in the 4 days is actually higher than on the 5 day work week which is why companies are implementing it. It takes a 5 second internet search to show that worker productivity keeps going up while wages are largely stagnant.
1065,"@Starparik I won't be too sure about that.  AI may create more work as we have to authenticate or check on whether the data it used are correct, and AI is adamant that it is right even when it is corrected.  An error in the data will be propagated indefinitely."
1066,@GrumpyDog whatever you say comrade
1067,"@Angus McIntyre Wait.. So that's your answer to this? You think everyone can become plumbers, or that everyone is fit for trade-jobs like that?  Sorry to break it to you, but there are lots of different kinds of people out there, and the vast majority are not a match for those kinds of jobs, and even if they were, and we could actually employ everyone doing that, who'd then hire a plumber when they can fix it themselves? lol The value of being a plumber would become worthless.
Scolding individuals and telling them to ""be a plumber already"" is such a brainless response.. What's happening now requires a rethinking of our economic systems and societal requirements on the survival of individuals."
1068,And now is when we really need a windows phone
1069,"This feels like the turn of a new chapter with technology. We can now focus more on the important areas of work, rather than the admin which clutters our day. üòä"
1070,@TheEisst Probably what Scott said at first and what you've said later.
1071,Or you'll be made redundant soon. One or the other.
1072,I'm affraid
1073,"Wow, this is incredible news Microsoft! The new AI copilot features in all Microsoft 365 sound absolutely amazing. I can't wait to try them out. It's so exciting to see how technology is advancing and how Microsoft is leading the way. Thank you to the developers at Microsoft who worked tirelessly to bring these new features to life. Your hard work and dedication are truly appreciated, and you are making a real difference in the lives of Microsoft 365 users. Keep up the great work!"
1074,"The best part is how it let us make use of more features that unfortunately are underused due to their complexity and time consuming nature. But now we can create more professional and creative slides, documents, lists, etc with just our words improving our own finished work"
1075,Looking forward to GPT5
1076,WOWWW
1077,"This is heaven, but so sad that not everyone will get to experience it, for economic reasons. Humanity may not be ready for this"
1078,"@Kougami yea with the current arms race between the giants, odds the side effects could be huge and hidden. People and a peoples who will not opt into this closed proprietary technology for some reason may be knocked off the species pool fr this time"
1079,the government cannot afford the unemployment checks for this lol
1080,Google is F*cked üòÖ
1081,"Oh boy, what a success! I don‚Äôt know what Google shows at IO, but the bar set by MSFT is sky high! In one feel swoop MSFT has regained the most exciting tech company image."
1082,"Microsoft and, honestly, even Meta have come forward with visions that have the potential to revolutionise the world (and even though Meta's vision isn't working out, it is still appearing to be catching on with the trend rather quickly). Amazon has been neither here nor there. Google and Apple have been sitting on their a33es doing absolutely nothing other than totally fruitless behind-the-scenes development. 

These companies have a lot of ground to make up to stay relevant."
1083,And then the ethics team gets laid off...
1084,Hate to say that: But that's great stuff! I BET WE WILL ALL HAVE TO GET MORE WORK DONE! :)
1085,"So at the end, the rumours about chatgpt4's ability to process images And videos was actually true. It's sad openai did not release it on its platform but sold it to the Microsoft."
1086,I would be very ashamed as a parent if I ever have to do a power point presentation for any of my child. Awkwardest example ever
1087,"Geez this is the first technological advancement that made me excited. BTW, I am an average Joe"
1088,these speeches maight have been created by AIüòÇüòÇüòÇ
1089,"That‚Äôs actually interesting, do these people use this technology in their day to day life? How have they accustomed to it? What are the limits ?"
1090,This is amazing!
1091,Ever since ChatGPT released A.I. has just blown my mind one day after the other.  In 2024 i wont have to work anymore because the f*cking singularity might have already happened.
1092,why doesn't anyone in the demo use dark mode?!
1093,"I'm speechless... It not only wrote the entire word document, it also converted into a professional powerpoint presentation... Imagine taking a test, copy pasting the entire text into word and just ask it to ""Fill in the blanks"". School has become obsolete, Microsoft has just fulfilled the dreams of millions of students."
1094,"I knew we'd get here eventually, it's surprising to see it happen so quickly. The speed of business has just increased exponentially."
1095,The nature of the singularity is it will happen quickly. It's an exponential curve.
1096,They must have been working on this for some time now in secret. Impossible to do this in one quarter.
1097,It‚Äôs a really beautiful thing to see and experience. I really can‚Äôt wait to see what the next few years have in store for us.
1098,This is incredible!
1099,"The drudgery for me is in person meetings, the talking bit. I love to draw and even compose PowerPoints, don't want AI to auto complete the fun part. I don't get the message? how can AI help with this?"
1100,"I don't think people understand the full implications of this.  By default, just about everything in your user directory ends up on OneDrive, which is now accessible to an AI that understands what it's looking at. Like, if you have a bunch of pictures of your cat on your Windows computer, an AI now knows what *your* cat looks like, and it know that it's your cat specifically."
1101,"But it's alright because you'll never have to do anything for your child. Why write a heart-felt speech for your daughter, when you can have 365 Co-pilot write it for you. I'm sure your daughter will love her 365 Co-pilot mother. What dystopian nonsense is this?"
1102,Are you a single woman living with her cat?
1103,"why are you so scared, privacy freak?"
1104,gov licking its lips at this. you are now totally owned. sentiment analysis of your soc media - already done. not in agreement? BYEEEEEEEEEE
1105,"It already transcripts audio from live video feed, it can scan pretty much everything on your PC. Scary, man"
1106,When will IT be avaible in Android?
1107,"10:52 ""As you may already know, my daughter Tasha, is graduating from high school this year, and we would like to invite you to celebrate this special occasion with us.""
The second comma, after Tasha, shouldn't be there. I find difficult to believe that a language model like GPT-4 (or even GPT-3) would fail to know this. My concern is not really the comma, but what it implies: I can think of 2 scenarios:
(1) The internet is so full of bad writing that the language models are copying it, big common mistakes included. (Never seen one in the last two or three months with ChatGPT, though.) Or:
(2) This presentation was hand-made by a human, because they don't have the product ready yet.
My guess goes with (2)."

1140,"@Yark this has everything to do with edge lol. Microsoft is trying to take over search market share from google. They‚Äôre launching early 1- because they unironically do have a better product considering they own OpenAi, but google‚Äôs BardAI is developing quick with the LAMDA model. This is about how people search their questions on the internet in the future. We‚Äôre also slowly moving away from the search engine to a chat based engine.

1197,"Wow the full presentation is like an entire uncanny valley presented... it reduces humans to just appendages of the empire. They show zero concern about inserting a ministerial technology between human relationships (written and verbal languages are technologies the individuals control, unlike copilot). Some parts of the presentation seem deliberately provocative to subconsciously and gradually inoculate us for this ministerial management of every aspect of our lives; as if this is just the next step in a case that has always been, and not a radical deviation from individual divinity towards individual subjugation. Hopefully society recognises the parent using AI for relating with their family, should receive the same disdain as an executive using a secretary for the same. Or that Microsoft wanting to train its models on everything of yours that is personal and professional is about anticompetitive monopolisation into empire, not empowering competition of sovereignty. The whole presentation had as much respect for humanity, as the ethics team vocalising concern while glazing off into a teleprompter being the face of a faceless regime, an appendage of an empire."

My concern is, that humankind will be very dependent on those, while they are in the hand of a big corporation. Also maybe people loosing their ability to do certain things with their own brain, because this solution is just to easy.

1288,Google announced their implementation 2 days ago. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6DaJVZBXETE
1289,"To be fair, the Google AI that powered Google products has been at work for years. I don't like most of these AIs because you can't really trust them. Even if it says ' i did this' it might be wrong and did sth. wrong.
As long as Transformers are bound to their sequential nature, it won't be able to do more combinatorically difficult tasks. The more vertical the embedded space vetors become, the more data you would need. And there are mathematically hard limits to this."
1290,"‚Äã@Teemu Palviainen compared with Google docs, sheets?"
1291,"I always liked Google products more than their MS counterparts - I'm not a heavy user of excel etc. anyway.  Recently decided to go freelancing, and the decision between Google Workspace and MS 365 was an obvious one."
1292,"@Janek Chmielewski Clearly safe enough for Duolingo, Khan Academy and Morgan Stanley, among a growing list of others to sign up for the API.  I would estimate the greater risk to your company would be to ignore AI and fall behind competitively and end up out of business as your competitors all fly by you.  If you watch enough demos testing what GPT-4 can do, you'll most likely agree it's about as big a discovery in reality to FIRE.

Keep in mind ""analyze your document"" doesn't mean ""we grab your document, pass it around at lunch and all comment on it"".  There wouldn't be much interest in an API that you pay for that then spies on you.   Secondly, what would Microsoft, a software company, DO with some info it got, say, from a Morgan Stanley document?

Lastly, most of the demonstration here was Bing CREATING FOR YOU.  The use cases for ""analyzing"" fall around it commenting on a .PDF to summarize it when researching something, so since you could read the .PDF, not much at risk there."

1298,"This is extremely exciting, but it will take real stewardship and organizational leadership to help proactively support this change in digital excellence. These will be entirely new skills for most workers they are developing (how to work alongside AI). While I am incredibly excited about how this makes AI more accessible and levels the playing field for the advantages it can bring to employees, it will be essential to reflect carefully on the accuracy of it as hallucinations in a business context driven by the language models or by the Microsoft layers could have very painful and significant impacts on employees and employers when it does get it wrong. 

We are all learning together, but this is a huge milestone and a step in the right direction. This is too important to leave in the hands of technologists alone, and the business needs to engage far more, and now with GPT4 and this, I hope more people begin to embrace and engage on how we can navigate this journey better together."
1299,These product will go through trial test. We don't get to test the product now but we can test out using Bing AI powered search because it is using a refined model of GPT4.
1300,"the purpose of copilot, gpt, nlp, etc is to reduce the amount of time wasted reflecting, analyzing, and nitpicking data.  these large organizations started realizing that big data is really just a big blur. with ai we can actually synthesize some of that information.  also for future reference you shouldn't use chat gpt to write youtube comments."

1331,"@Michael Schneider I disagree. AI is going to become the pilot in coding in the end. Further, even as copilots, AI will reduce the demand for coders in the labor market due to extreme efficiency gains. Lower demand = lower wages and/or fewer coders."
1332,too bad AI will put them out of work.
1333,devil worshippers
1334,nah bros wrote themselves out of a job
1335,@SAI SOORYA MARRI AI won't replace human but it will boots it 100X faster and make life easy. AI won't and can't replace we programmers. cause  AI and system will still need us.. :)
1336,"Awesome. Nuevos modelos de negocio, nuevos retos (escasez de agua, calentamiento global, nuevos alimentos, energia de fusi√≥n, curar el c√°ncer...). Si la a veces mezquina naturaleza humana no lo impide, estas tecnolog√≠as nos ayudaran a construir, juntos, un futuro mejor para todos. Mas sostenible y mas justo."
1337,"This is a great milestone.  You've now set creative people free from development hustles. Copilots are now the new shareholders. I've one question though. is there a plan to develop such models for other languages? I.e. I am not referring to the usual famous languages but to languages being spoken in Africa. This is because we can use these to fulfill our people's many basic needs. I imagine a day when traditional farmers in my nation use such friendly models to produce crops so we solve our current problem of crop production. school feeding, and wealth redistribution so we finally have a  healthy self-sustained economy.  I hope Microsoft has a plan too.  Again, Thanks a lot for the hard work."
1338,Oh they have a plan. A plan to centrailize control and wealth
1339,You can start talking to any openai powered chatbot in another language and it will work. The disadvantage is that there's less data in some languages and that can make the bot perform significantly worse. I'm talking from personal experience with Hebrew
1340,"Generally, the more data there is available for a language, the better an LLM does on it. You can push it to learn more by giving it more data / feedback (as is being done with Icelandic) but Microsoft would find it hard to make data that simply isn't there."
1341,@yohannes teklu lol ! üòÇ
1342,"The bottleneck on being able to translate languages is data. Especially with the digital divide there is simply not enough data in these languages to produce grammatically correct and intelligent-sounding output. But the amount of data available on the internet increases every year, so it will hopefully be possible eventually, especially if more people from these places get access to the internet."
1343,I had to watch this thing twice. Something amazing is coming.
1344,please spanish subs
1345,Can Microsoft 365 family users use Microsoft 365 Copilot? When?
1346,Wow ! Just Wow
1347,Google employees losing their minds atm
1348,"Google stock owners, tbh.."
1349,@Super Mario It's like having the most powerful car engine without knowing how to design a sport car.
1350,@wildreams Im sure there will be a third party add on that can interact with google drive
1351,üòÇüòÇüòÇ I'm dead
1352,@ANJ Forgive me if I don't cry when someone steals the information of the biggest information thief ever.
1353,"Nice! But where is copilot (digital assistant) for the Windows? There should be a sidebar for it in the notification area for it. It should have the option to be always-on. It should have the speech to text and text to speech options (with different voices). It would be a huge omission if it is not included. Also no mention of image to text in the copilot? I think with the available technology, these could be easily integrated. Lets see, how the Apple vows the world with this."
1354,Maybe in Windows 12
1355,"@–ù–æ—Å—É—Ö–∞ nah, a full year."
1356,It'll get there. Give it half a year

1365,"I'm worried about my job now, whatever they say..."
1366,@Abhinav Tiwari what's stopping it from doing exactly that?
1367,@Immortal ZoDD I doubt it will happen unless AI understands the on ground situation
1368,"@Abhinav Tiwari Yeah, the human that needs the contract and uses AI. If AI is unqualified to give advice now, tomorrow it will"
1369,@SolidState Every organization has their own risk appetite.  You will need to make AI understand your risk to get those suggestions ? No matter how capable AI gets  a human judgment would always be needed
1370,"@Abhinav Tiwari How will it NOT understand the various risk clauses which go into those contracts? AI will not only draft the contracts, it will also act as counsel for the other party, summarizing and explaining the contract, and recommending necessary changes. And it will do it in minutes, not days or weeks. 

The one benefit here however, is that it's a licensed field and human involvement will likely be regulated, if for no other reason than to have a fall guy if something goes wrong."
1371,I was here when the web changed to 4.0
1372,I want AI completely unleashed
1373,oh you don't have to wait long
1374,Am I missing when it will be available?

I have two questions though. When will this be available and will it be available on Microsoft 365 Personal and Family?"
